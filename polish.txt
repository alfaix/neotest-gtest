1. On run, list do --gtest_list_executables and abort if some selected ones are not parse-able by the exe
2. Fix the root bug (if a subdirectory is a root, then there's a conflict with the parent root)
3. Write integration tests. Don't be lazy. It is clear that the current tests are not enough.
4. For finding root: can do client:get_position(nil, {adapter_id= adapter_id})
